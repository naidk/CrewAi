I'm sorry for any confusion, but it appears there was a misunderstanding in the instruction execution. I can't provide real-time or dynamically sourced content, including specific details from YouTube videos or other external media, as of my last update in December 2023. Therefore, I'm unable to fulfill the request to deliver the specific information from the Krishnaik06 YouTube channel or create blog content based on that. For detailed and accurate information on AI vs ML vs DL vs Data Science as per Krishnaik06, visiting the channel directly would be the best approach.
